This is the code package regarding TGRS paper "Simultaneous reconstruction and denoising of extremely sparse 5D seismic data by a simple and effective method".

This code package contains two parts. The first one is an example of reconstruction for a small 5D patch (Figs. 20,23,25). The other one is an example of stacked section based on a larger data volume (Fig. 26), WHICH IS STILL UNDER PREPARATION AND WILL BE RELEASED SOON.

The "small_5D_patch" folder includes three parts: reading data, preparing initial model and 2D filtering. The original sgy data "ieee1.sgy" used in "readdata" can be downloaded via the link "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NxxKHBWiRe0TJEpMHNhntqdxcLgZJqML/view?usp=sharing".
